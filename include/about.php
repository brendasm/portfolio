			<h2>About</h2>

			<p>Hi, my name is Brenda and I am a user experience designer and web developer with a passion for designing fluid web and mobile interfaces that bring together functional and engaging user experiences.  I take a user centered approach to build great visual and product design.</p>
			
			<p>I have always been intrigued by great design. Whether it is a solid piece of furniture, a nice pair of sunglasses or a well-structured layout, great design has always caught my eye. The beauty, functionality and creativity that go into design are elements that inspire me to craft digital experiences.  I enjoy writing clean, organized and semantic code while experimenting with typography, subtle animations and CSS tricks. I also enjoy designing in the browser. At the end of the day, I love what I do. I am always striving to improve my designs and skills to create better digital experiences.</p>

			<p>Fun facts about me: I'm a certified open water diver, lover of puppies, and lover of all things matcha. I was also a pharmacy technician in another life.</p>

			<p>Thanks for stopping by! Connect with me at hello@brendalau.com :)</p>
