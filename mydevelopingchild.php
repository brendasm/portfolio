				<div class="description">
					<p><span class="bold">Project Goals</span>The goal of this project aims to achieve two goals: to educate users/parents on the genetic cause of autism and to increase the number of sign ups.</p>
					<p>The design and development of this project provides a clean, easy to navigate, and family friendly site that is accessible by all devices. The overall project was completed in a tight span of five weeks and was a collaborative effort with two other awesome team members. We worked closely with our client, based in Utah, to establish the development of the site.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="description">
					<p><span class="bold">Initial Meeting</span> &nbsp; We had an in-person discovery meeting with the client to better understand the scope of the project and the following information: </p>

					<ul class="bullet-list">
						<li>Objective of the site</li>
						<li>Priorities to consider for the development of the site</li>
						<li>Users or target audience</li>
						<li>The primary task users are looking to accomplish when using site </li>
						<li>Competitors</li>
						<li>Design features</li>
						<li>Brand guideline/colors/typefaces</li>
						<li>Style/tone or imagery to consider</li>
					</ul>

					<p><span class="bold">Process</span> &nbsp; From the details uncovered in the discovery meeting, we then began the research phase. We worked with the client to conduct 5 in-person interviews and 15 survey interviews of users (parents) selected from various advocacy groups.</p>
				</div> <!-- end description -->

				<div class="description">
					<p><span class="bold">Key Findings</span></p>
					<ul class="bullet-list">
						<li>Average age of users are 25-35 years old</li>
						<li>Users would spend approximately 10 minutes visiting a health education site</li>
						<li>Users would revisit a site if there are current news/events that are frequently updated</li>
						<li>Users prefer to view sites on desktop for more in depth analysis. However, when they are on the go, they enjoy a mobile friendly site for quick information </li>
						<li>Users expect to find clear, easy to locate content/information that does not have a lot jargon</li>
						<li>Besides health education sites, users would also frequent blogs, WebMD and advocacy sites </li>
						<li>If the site has social media links, users are likely to follow to get access of more information </li>
						<li>Users are frustrated by sites that are vague, hard to navigate (don’t know where to click next) and do not have credible sources</li>
					</ul>

					<p> <span class="bold">Color Swatch </span> &nbsp; We decided on the following colors to establish a family-friendly tone. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="swatch">
					<div class="swatch-single mdc1"><p>#01667D</p></div>
					<div class="swatch-single mdc2"><p>#0099B5</p></div>
					<div class="swatch-single mdc3"><p>#0CA2C7</p></div>
					<div class="swatch-single mdc4"><p>#7A93A0</p></div>
					<div class="swatch-single mdc5"><p>#4C4C4C</p></div>			
				</div> <!-- end swatch -->	

				<div class="description">
					<p><span class="bold">Development</span> &nbsp; The site was built on a custom WordPress theme. Each page was coded separately since the structural content of each page was different.  With a user centered approach, we incorporated various dynamic elements to enhance the overall usability of the site with specific functions enabled/disabled across various devices. </p>
					<p>We also implemented a progress bar at the bottom of each page so that users can navigate through the informational ‘steps’ of autism from screening to support. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="description">
					<p><span class="bold">User Testing</span> &nbsp; For the final portion of the project, we conducted a site testing to determine the usability and efficiency of the site. The site testing allowed us to observe a user’s interaction with the interface, layout and content and to validate specific features that were incorporated into the site. Overall, the testing provided a lot of valuable feedback to the design and development of the site. </p>
