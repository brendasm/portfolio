		<p>My Developing Child is an educational website for a non-profit organization that focuses on bringing awareness to autism and provides information from screening, signs, diagnosis, management and advocacy support groups.  The main requirements for the design and development of this project was to create a clean, easy to navigate and family friendly site.  </p>
		<p>The project was completed over a tight span of five weeks and was a collaborative effort with two other awesome team members. We worked closely with our client, based in Utah, to establish the development of the site. </p>
