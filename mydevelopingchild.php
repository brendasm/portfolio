									<p>My Developing Child is an educational website for a non-profit organization that focuses on bringing awareness to autism. The main requirements for the design and development of this project was to create a clean and easy to navigate site. With a user centered approach, we incorporated various dynamic elements to enhance the overall usability of the site with specific functions enabled/disabled at various screen sizes. </p>

								<p>The project was a collaborative effort with two other team members. </p>
